            <h3>About the Red Fort</h3>
            <p>The Red Fort, known as Lal Qila, is an iconic historical fort situated in the heart of Old Delhi, India. It was the main residence of the Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years, from 1648 to 1857. Built by Emperor Shah Jahan, the fort is an outstanding example of Mughal architecture, incorporating Persian, Timurid, and Indian styles.</p>
            <p>Constructed primarily from red sandstone, the fort is a stunning symbol of the grandeur and elegance of the Mughal Empire. Its design represents the combination of Islamic and Indian styles, featuring intricate carvings, large gardens, and grand gates. The fort's architecture is renowned for its sheer scale, its beautiful pavilions, and its numerous defensive features.</p>
            <p>The fort also houses the famous Mumtaz Mahal, which was the residence of the emperor's queens and concubines. Another notable structure within the fort is the Samarkand-style mosque, the Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque), built by Emperor Aurangzeb for the royal family’s private use. The fort is surrounded by a deep moat and high walls, providing protection from potential invaders.</p>
            <p>In 1857, during the Indian Rebellion, the fort was captured by the British, marking the end of the Mughal Empire. Today, it stands as a national symbol of India’s history and independence and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The fort’s beautiful structures, gardens, and galleries have attracted millions of visitors from around the world, making it one of India’s most famous landmarks.</p>         </div>
