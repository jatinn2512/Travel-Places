            <h3>About the Taj Mahal</h3>
            <p>The Taj Mahal is one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, located in Agra, India. It was commissioned by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1632 in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth. This magnificent structure symbolizes eternal love and devotion.</p>
            <p>It is considered a jewel of Muslim art in India and a globally admired masterpiece. The entire complex includes a mosque, a guest house, and beautiful gardens that enhance its charm and beauty.</p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>The Taj Mahal took around 22 years to complete, with an estimated workforce of 20,000 artisans, laborers, and engineers from across India and Central Asia. The main architect, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, ensured every detail reflected the grandeur of Mughal craftsmanship.</p>
            <p>The mausoleum is built using white Makrana marble, which was brought from Rajasthan. Precious and semi-precious stones like jade, turquoise, lapis lazuli, and onyx were intricately embedded into the walls, giving it a unique elegance. The symmetry of the Taj Mahal is a defining feature, and the structure appears identical from all four sides, making it an architectural wonder.</p>
            <p>Legends say that Shah Jahan planned to build a black Taj Mahal for himself across the Yamuna River, but his son, Aurangzeb, overthrew him before he could execute the plan. Today, the Taj Mahal remains a symbol of the Mughal Empireâ€™s grandeur and cultural richness.</p>

            <h3>Tourism</h3>
            <p>Today, the Taj Mahal is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world, drawing millions of visitors every year. It was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 due to its immense cultural and historical significance. Visitors from across the globe come to witness its mesmerizing beauty, especially during sunrise and sunset when the monument changes color.</p>
